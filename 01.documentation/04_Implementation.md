== Implementation

=== Step 1: Environment Setup
1. **Choose a Technology Stack**:
   - **Backend**: Java Spring Boot (Reactive with WebFlux).
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data.
   - **Security**: Spring Security and JWT for authentication.
   - **OAuth Client**: Spring Security OAuth2 for social login integration.

2. **Setup Development Environment**:
   - Install Java (JDK 11 or higher), PostgreSQL, Maven/Gradle, and IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
   - Initialize a new Spring Boot project with required dependencies:
     - Spring WebFlux
     - Spring Data R2DBC (Reactive PostgreSQL support)
     - Spring Security
     - Spring Boot Starter OAuth2 Client
     - Spring Boot Starter Validation
     - Spring Boot Starter Mail (for email features)

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Use `application.yml` for configuration:
     - Database credentials.
     - JWT secret key.
     - OAuth client credentials (Google, Facebook).
   - For sensitive information, use environment variables or a secrets manager.

=== Step 2: Build Core Components
1. **Database Setup**:
   - Create the schema for `users`, `roles`, `user_roles`, `tokens`, and `social_logins`.
   - Use Flyway or Liquibase for schema migrations.

2. **Authentication Service**:
   - Implement endpoints:
     - `/register`: Handle user registration.
     - `/login`: Authenticate users and issue JWT tokens.
     - `/logout`: Invalidate tokens.
     - `/refresh-token`: Issue new access tokens.

   - Use `BCryptPasswordEncoder` for password hashing.
   - Implement token generation with `io.jsonwebtoken` (JJWT).

3. **Social Login Integration**:
   - Configure Spring Security OAuth2 Client:
     - Add `client-id` and `client-secret` for Google and Facebook in `application.yml`.
   - Handle callback responses to create or find users in the `social_logins` table.

4. **Token Management**:
   - Use JWT for stateless tokens.
   - Implement token validation and refreshing.
   - Store token metadata (e.g., refresh tokens) in the `tokens` table.

=== Step 3: Security Enhancements
1. **Password Encryption**:
   - Use `BCryptPasswordEncoder` with a strong salt for storing passwords securely.

2. **Spring Security Configuration**:
   - Configure a security filter chain to protect routes.
   - Add role-based access controls.

3. **HTTPS Setup**:
   - Use Spring Boot’s SSL support for HTTPS configuration.
   - Use TLS certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt) for production.

4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate-limiting using Redis and Spring Boot’s reactive capabilities.

---

=== Step 4: User Management Features
1. **Self-Service Features**:
   - Password Reset:
     - Use Spring Boot Starter Mail for sending password reset links.
     - Add endpoints for password reset token validation and updating passwords.
   - Email Verification:
     - Generate a token and send verification links during registration.

2. **Role Management**:
   - Implement admin endpoints for assigning and managing user roles.
   - Use Spring Security's `@PreAuthorize` or method-level annotations for role-based restrictions.

---

=== Step 5: API Gateway and Documentation
1. **API Gateway**:
   - Optionally integrate Spring Cloud Gateway for routing and load balancing.
   - Add logging and monitoring for incoming API requests.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Use SpringDoc OpenAPI for generating Swagger UI documentation.
   - Provide integration examples for client developers.

---

=== Step 6: Testing and Deployment
1. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests with JUnit 5.
   - Write integration tests for endpoints using WebTestClient for reactive testing.
   - Test OAuth and social login flows with mock identity providers.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Set up CI/CD using GitHub Actions or Jenkins for building and deploying the app.
   - Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application to AWS, GCP, or Azure.
   - Use managed PostgreSQL services for production.
   - Configure auto-scaling and monitoring for reactive services.

---

=== Step 7: Monitoring and Maintenance
1. **Centralized Logging**:
   - Use ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a cloud-based logging service.
   - Enable trace logging for debugging reactive flows.

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor app performance and database health.

3. **Security Audits**:
   - Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
   - Periodically test the system for weaknesses (e.g., penetration testing).

4. **Feature Iteration**:
   - Add new features like multi-factor authentication or support for additional social login providers based on user feedback.
