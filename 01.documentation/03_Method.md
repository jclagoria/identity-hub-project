=== Architecture Design

The application will follow a modular, service-oriented architecture. Key components include:

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user login/logout, token issuance, and validation.
- **User Management Service**: Manages user registration, profile updates, and role assignments.
- **Social Login Integrations**: OAuth 2.0-based integration with third-party identity providers like Google and Facebook.
- **Database Layer**: Stores user credentials, profiles, and token data securely.
- **API Gateway**: Central entry point for all external API requests, implementing rate-limiting and API authentication.

The high-level architecture diagram is as follows:

=== Database Schema

The database will use a relational structure, such as PostgreSQL, for flexibility and ACID compliance. The schema includes:

- **users**:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `email` (unique, indexed)
  - `password_hash` (encrypted string, nullable for social login users)
  - `is_email_verified` (boolean)
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` (timestamps)

- **roles**:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `name` (e.g., admin, user)

- **user_roles** (many-to-many relationship between users and roles):
  - `user_id` (foreign key to users)
  - `role_id` (foreign key to roles)

- **tokens**:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `user_id` (foreign key to users)
  - `access_token` (string)
  - `refresh_token` (string)
  - `expires_at` (timestamp)

- **social_logins**:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `user_id` (foreign key to users)
  - `provider` (e.g., Google, Facebook)
  - `provider_user_id` (string)

=== Key Algorithms and Workflows

1. **Registration**:
   - Accepts user email and password.
   - Hashes the password using bcrypt.
   - Stores user data in the `users` table.
   - Sends a verification email.

2. **Login**:
   - Validates email and password.
   - On success, generates access and refresh tokens.
   - Stores token details in the `tokens` table.

3. **Social Login**:
   - Uses OAuth 2.0 to fetch user information from the provider.
   - Checks if the provider's user ID exists in the `social_logins` table.
   - If not, creates a new entry in the `users` and `social_logins` tables.

4. **Token Refresh**:
   - Validates the refresh token.
   - If valid, generates new access and refresh tokens.

5. **Multi-factor Authentication (Optional)**:
   - On successful password login, prompts for a one-time code sent via email or generated by a TOTP app.
   - Validates the one-time code before issuing tokens.

6. **Logout**:
   - Invalidates tokens in the `tokens` table by setting `expires_at` to the current timestamp.

=== Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS for all API requests.
- Store sensitive information (e.g., passwords) securely using bcrypt with a strong salt.
- Implement rate-limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
- Ensure JWT tokens are signed using a secure algorithm (e.g., RS256).
- Periodically rotate secrets used for signing tokens.
