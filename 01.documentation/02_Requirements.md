== Requirements

=== Must Have
- A RESTful API for user registration, login, and account management.
- Email/password-based authentication.
- Social login support for major platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- Secure storage of user credentials using encryption and hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
- Token-based authentication using OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect standards (e.g., access and refresh tokens).
- Support for user account roles and permissions (e.g., admin, user).
- Secure logout functionality with token invalidation.
- Basic rate-limiting and IP-based throttling for brute force protection.

=== Should Have
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) using email or TOTP-based apps (e.g., Google Authenticator).
- Webhooks or event-driven notifications for actions like password changes and failed login attempts.
- Self-service features like password reset and email verification.

=== Could Have
- User activity logs for tracking login and account activity.
- API documentation with an interactive testing interface (e.g., Swagger or Postman).
- SDKs for easy integration with client apps (e.g., JavaScript, Python, mobile SDKs).
- Localization and multi-language support for user-facing components.

=== Wonâ€™t Have (for initial MVP)
- Support for biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition).
- Built-in analytics dashboards for administrators.
- Integration with lesser-used social login platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter).
