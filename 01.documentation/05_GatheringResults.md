== Gathering Results

=== Evaluation of Requirements
1. **Must-Have Features**:
   - Verify that all endpoints (e.g., registration, login, token refresh, social login) function as expected.
   - Test secure password storage using bcrypt and validate password reset and email verification workflows.
   - Ensure JWT token issuance and validation meet OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards.
   - Validate API security features such as HTTPS, rate-limiting, and role-based access control.

2. **Should-Have Features**:
   - Confirm multi-factor authentication (MFA) is functional if implemented.
   - Test the event-driven notification system for key actions (e.g., password changes).
   - Ensure smooth self-service operations for end users, including account recovery.

3. **Could-Have Features**:
   - Evaluate the performance and usability of optional features like activity logs and SDK integrations if implemented.

4. **Wonâ€™t-Have Features**:
   - Confirm that features not part of the MVP (e.g., biometric authentication) are excluded to avoid scope creep.

=== Performance Testing
- Conduct load testing using tools like JMeter or Locust to simulate high concurrent user activity.
- Measure:
  - **Response Times**: Ensure all endpoints meet performance thresholds under normal and peak loads.
  - **Scalability**: Test how well the system scales with an increasing number of users.
  - **Database Performance**: Validate query execution times and ensure no bottlenecks under load.

---

=== Security Testing
- Perform penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, CSRF, and XSS.
- Validate token security:
  - Ensure JWT tokens cannot be tampered with or reused after expiry.
  - Confirm refresh token implementation is secure.
- Evaluate OAuth integrations for secure handling of social login flows.

---

=== User Feedback
- Collect feedback from developers integrating the authentication service into their applications:
  - Ease of integration using the provided API and documentation.
  - User satisfaction with registration, login, and account recovery processes.
- Conduct usability testing for end users to identify areas of improvement in the self-service features.

---

=== Metrics to Track Success
1. **Functionality Metrics**:
   - Percentage of successfully completed user registrations and logins.
   - Rate of social login usage vs. email/password login.

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Average response time for core endpoints under typical and high loads.
   - Error rates and API downtime statistics.

3. **Security Metrics**:
   - Number of blocked brute-force attempts and rate-limiting activations.
   - Frequency of reported security vulnerabilities.

---

=== Iterative Improvement
- Analyze results and prioritize improvements based on:
  - Security audit findings.
  - Performance bottlenecks.
  - User feedback on usability and integration challenges.
- Plan for iterative updates to address identified issues and expand features (e.g., additional social login providers, MFA).
