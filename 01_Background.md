== Background

The User Management and Authentication App is a standalone authentication service designed for integration with other systems. This service will act as the central authority for managing user identities and providing secure authentication mechanisms for external applications.

The app supports:
- Email/password-based login for traditional authentication.
- Social login integration (e.g., Google, Facebook) to provide seamless login experiences.

This service caters to developers building applications requiring secure, scalable, and easy-to-integrate authentication solutions. It follows modern security standards such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of systems while safeguarding user credentials.

The system's primary goals are:
- To provide a robust and reusable identity management service.
- To streamline integration into client applications via APIs and SDKs.
- To ensure a secure and user-friendly authentication process.
